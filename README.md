### Project 2: Low-Cost PMU for Smart Grid - Final Year Project

In an era where energy sustainability is of paramount importance, our "Low-Cost PMU Design for Real-Time Monitoring in Smart Grids" project stands as a beacon of innovation. We have harnessed cutting-edge technology to create a powerful solution that empowers utilities and consumers alike to monitor and optimize electrical parameters in real-time, fostering an era of efficient and sustainable energy management.

**Key Features:**

- **Affordable Precision**: Our PMU (Phasor Measurement Unit) design strikes the perfect balance between cost-effectiveness and high-precision measurements, making it accessible to a wide range of applications and users.

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Seamlessly monitor voltage, current, frequency, and other vital electrical parameters in real-time, enabling swift response to grid fluctuations and ensuring uninterrupted power supply.

- **Angular Front End**: Our intuitive Angular-based front-end interface offers an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly dashboard for convenient data visualization and control.

- **Node.js Back End**: The robust Node.js back end ensures scalability, reliability, and efficient data processing.

### Project 3: Information Security Project

This project demonstrates secure data transmission between a client and server using encryption and decryption with the AES-GCM algorithm. The server receives encrypted data from clients, decrypts it, and stores the information in a MongoDB database. The client and server establish a secure connection through a handshake protocol to ensure data confidentiality.

## Features

- **Secure Connection**: The client and server establish a secure connection using a handshake mechanism before transmitting data.

- **AES-GCM Encryption**: Data is encrypted using the AES-GCM encryption algorithm to ensure confidentiality and integrity during transmission.

- **Decryption Time Measurement**: The server measures the time it takes to decrypt incoming data and displays it in milliseconds.

- **MongoDB Integration**: Decrypted data is stored in a MongoDB database for further processing or analysis.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-data-transmission.git`

2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Run the server script: `python server.py`.

4. Run the client script: `python client.py`.

5. Secure data transmission is now set up, and you can observe encryption and decryption times in the server's console.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyCryptodome
